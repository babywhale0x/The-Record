# The Record

> Censorship-resistant investigative journalism and government document archive for Nigeria and West Africa — built on Shelby Protocol (Aptos blockchain).

Every article stored permanently. Every source document hash-committed on-chain. Every payment wallet-to-wallet. No platform can take it down.

---

## What it is

Independent journalists in Nigeria face payment processor blocks, government takedowns, and editorial interference. The Record is infrastructure that removes all three attack surfaces:

- **Articles + source documents** stored as blobs on Shelby Protocol (decentralised storage on Aptos)
- **Cryptographic hash** of every article committed to Aptos at publish time — any future alteration is immediately detectable
- **Direct wallet-to-wallet payments** — readers pay journalists directly; no bank, no processor, no middleman
- **Dead man's switch** — time-locked article releases via Aptos smart contract
- **Background archive** — automatic scraper pipeline for INEC, BPP, EFCC, NASS, CBN, NJC public documents
- **Two-sided publishing** — journalists choose public or private per article; private articles are end-to-end encrypted

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-record.git
cd the-record
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in your Shelby + Aptos keys
npm run dev
```

To get your keys:
```bash
npm i -g @shelby-protocol/cli
shelby init
shelby faucet --network testnet
shelby account list
```

Copy `private_key` and `address` from `~/.shelby/config.yaml` into `.env.local`.

## Petra Web / Aptos Connect Setup

If extension wallets work but Petra Web (Google sign-in) fails, the issue is usually Aptos Connect configuration, not your UI code.

1. Create or open your Aptos Connect app at `https://aptosconnect.app`.
2. Add your exact frontend domains to the app allowlist:
   - local dev: `http://localhost:3000`
   - production: your deployed domain (for example your Vercel URL and custom domain)
3. Copy your Aptos Connect dapp id into `.env.local`:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_CONNECT_DAPP_ID=...`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_NETWORK=testnet` (or `mainnet` if your app is mainnet)
4. Restart the dev server after env changes.

The app now reads Aptos Connect settings from env instead of hardcoding a single dapp id, which prevents domain mismatch issues across local/dev/prod.

### ⏳ Pending — Privacy & Identity Layer

These features are the next engineering priority. They address the real threat model for journalists operating in Nigeria.

#### P1 — Pseudonymous Publishing
- Journalists publish under a pen name (chosen at wallet creation), not their real name
- Real identity is held only in a sealed, offline-encrypted editorial register — never in the database
- The platform never links a wallet address to a real person publicly

#### P2 — Stealth Wallet Addresses (per-article)
- Each article is published from a **one-time derived address**, not the journalist's main wallet
- Prevents chain-tracing: a reader or government actor cannot look up a journalist's wallet and see all their articles, earnings, or identity
- The journalist controls all derived addresses from one master key — they don't manage multiple wallets
- Critical for physical safety: a journalist with ₦2m in on-chain earnings from a corruption piece is a target

#### P3 — Two-Sided Publishing (Public vs Private)
- **Public** — article visible to all readers on `/investigations`; content stored unencrypted on Shelby; Aptos hash is public
- **Private** — article visible only to wallet-holders who have been granted access; content is **end-to-end encrypted** before it leaves the browser using the reader's Aptos public key; even Shelby storage providers cannot read it
- Journalist chooses Public or Private per article in the editor Settings tab
- Private articles can be shared with: specific wallets (named sources, editors, lawyers), paid subscribers only, or embargoed until a date (dead man's switch)
- Private does not mean hidden from the archive — the hash and timestamp are still committed on-chain; only the content is encrypted

#### P4 — Journalist Privacy Controls (Dashboard)
- Toggle: show/hide real name on published articles
- Toggle: show/hide wallet address on published articles
- Option to publish fully anonymously (no name, no address — just the on-chain proof)
- Manage which wallets have access to private articles
- Revoke access to private articles (re-encrypt with new key set, old key invalidated)

#### P5 — Source Submission Portal (Anonymous)
- Separate `/submit` route for anonymous sources to submit documents
- Tor-accessible — no IP logged, no cookies
- End-to-end encrypted upload direct to journalist's Shelby inbox
- Source never needs a wallet — they submit via a journalist's public submission link
- Journalist's submission link is a derived key, not their main address

#### P6 — Minimal Data Collection
- Strip real name, Twitter handle, city from the apply form — editorial verification happens off-platform
- No analytics, no tracking, no third-party scripts
- All auth is wallet-signature based — no email/password database to breach

### ⏳ Pending — Infrastructure

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Government archive scraper | Node.js + Playwright; INEC, BPP, EFCC, NASS, CBN first |
| Real wallet auth | Aptos wallet connect (Petra, Martian) replacing mock Bearer token |
| Smart contract | Dead man's switch, hash commitment, access control for private articles |
| Blob renewal cron | Auto-renew Shelby blobs before expiry |
| IPFS/Fleek mirror | Censorship-resistant frontend deployment (survives domain seizure) |
| `/archive` search UI | Full-text search across all archived government documents |
| `/verify` page | Public tool — paste any Aptos tx hash, verify document integrity |
| `/about`, `/pricing` pages | |
| `.onion` mirror | Tor hidden service for the full platform |

## Privacy Architecture (Design Intent)

```
Journalist's real identity
        │
        │  never stored on platform
        ▼
  Pen name + Master Aptos key
        │
        ├──► Article 1 → derived address A → Shelby blob → Aptos tx
        ├──► Article 2 → derived address B → Shelby blob → Aptos tx
        └──► Article 3 → derived address C → Shelby blob → Aptos tx (PRIVATE: encrypted)

Reader wanting private article:
  Reader wallet pubkey → journalist encrypts blob → only reader's privkey can decrypt
```

No single point of failure. No database of journalist identities. No traceable wallet history.
